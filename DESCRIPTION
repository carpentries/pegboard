Description: The Carpentries (<https://carpentries.org>) curricula is made
    of of lessons that are hosted as websites. Each lesson represents
    between a half day to two days of instruction and contains several
    episodes, which are written as 'kramdown'-flavored 'markdown'
    documents and converted to HTML using the 'Jekyll' static website
    generator. This package builds on top of the 'tinkr' package; reads in
    these markdown documents to 'XML' and stores them in R6 classes for
    convenient exploration and manipulation of sections within episodes.
